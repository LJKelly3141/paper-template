# Data Directory README

This directory contains two main sub-directories: `raw` and `processed`.

## Directory Structure

Below is an overview of the directory structure:

```
data/
├── raw/
├── processed/
└── data_description.xlsx
```

### `raw/`

The `raw/` directory contains the data as it was originally downloaded. This data has not been cleaned or processed in any way, and is preserved in its original format for transparency and reproducibility. Use this data if you want to conduct your own data processing or if you want to verify the data cleaning steps.

**Note:** This data might contain inconsistencies, errors, or missing values, as it is often the case with raw data.

### `processed/`

The `processed/` directory contains the data that has been cleaned, and prepared for further analysis or modeling. 

### `data_description.md`

This is a MS Excel file that provides detailed information about the data. It includes descriptions for each feature, the source of the data, the methods used for data cleaning and processing, and any other relevant details.

## Using This Data

Ensure that you understand the cleaning and transformation steps that have been performed on the data in `processed/`. Refer to the `data_description.xlsx` file for more details.

Always consider the ethical implications of using this data. Ensure that your use of the data complies with all relevant data protection laws and regulations.
